# Welcome to Comprehensive Rust
This is a four day Rust course developed by the Android team.

## Day1

This is the first day of Comprehensive Rust. We will cover a lot of ground today:
- Basic Rust syntax: variables, scalar and compound types, enums, structs, references, functions, and methods.

- Memory management: stack vs heap, manual memory management, scope-based memory management, and garbage collection.

- Ownership: move semantics, copying and cloning, borrowing, and lifetimes.
