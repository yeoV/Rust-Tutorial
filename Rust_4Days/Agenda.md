# Welcome to Comprehensive Rust
This is a four day Rust course developed by the Android team.

## Day1

This is the first day of Comprehensive Rust. We will cover a lot of ground today:
- Basic Rust syntax: variables, scalar and compound types, enums, structs, references, functions, and methods.

- Memory management: stack vs heap, manual memory management, scope-based memory management, and garbage collection.

- Ownership: move semantics, copying and cloning, borrowing, and lifetimes.




## Day2
- Structs, enums, methods.

- Pattern matching: destructuring enums, structs, and arrays.

- Control flow constructs: if, if let, while, while let, break, and continue.

- The Standard Library: String, Option and Result, Vec, HashMap, Rc and Arc.

- Modules: visibility, paths, and filesystem hierarchy.
